# RabbitMQ Public Umbrella

This repository makes it easier to work on multiple RabbitMQ sub-projects
at once. It is no longer a requirement for working on an individual plugin
thanks to `erlang.mk`.


## Initial Clone

After you clone the umbrella for the first time, use

``` shell
make co -j 32
```

to clone all dependencies. They will be checked out under `deps`.

Dependencies (sub-projects) are named after their Erlang application
names. Mostly they are self-explanatory but there are some less obvious
cases for historical reasons:

 * `rabbit` is RabbitMQ server
 * `amqp_client` is RabbitMQ Erlang client (AMQP 0-9-1)
 * `rabbit_common` is a library shared by the above
 * `rabbitmq_server_release` contains release automation and packaging bits
 * `rabbitmq_java_client` also contains integration test suites for the server

## Running RabbitMQ from Source

To run a RabbitMQ node built from source without any plugins, change to the `deps/rabbit`
directory and run:

``` shell
make run-broker
```

If you need to access log files, use

``` shell
rabbitmqctl log_tail -N 300

# streams logs to standard output
# rabbitmqctl log_tail_stream
```

or see node data directories under `$TMPDIR/rabbit*`.



## Running RabbitMQ with Plugins

To build a package, and all its dependencies, cd into the package
directory under `deps` and run `make`.

To start RabbitMQ from a plugin directory, use `make run-broker`.

To run a node with multiple plugins, cd into `deps/rabbitmq_server_release`, and run
it with `PLUGINS` listing the plugins you need:

``` shell
make run-broker PLUGINS='rabbitmq_management rabbitmq_consistent_hash_exchange'
```

To run a node built from source with multiple plugins and a config file, use

``` shell
make run-broker PLUGINS='rabbitmq_management rabbitmq_consistent_hash_exchange' RABBITMQ_CONFIG_FILE=/path/to/config/file
```


## Running Tests

### Integration Tests

Integration tests require that you have JDK *+ and Maven 3.x installed.
To run all test suites with:

``` shell
cd deps/rabbitmq_java_client
make tests
```

### Full Server Tests

To run all server tests, use

``` shell
cd deps/rabbit
make tests
```

Note that the above can take up to 2 hours depending on the hardware.

To run a subset of the most essential tests:

``` shell
make ct-fast
```

### Sub-projects

To run tests for a sub-project, run

``` shell
make tests
```

from its directory.



## Variables That Can Be Set When Building

The following variables can be passed on the 'make' command line in
order to configure builds.

 * `ERL`: the Erlang 'erl' command to use, `erl` by default

 * `ERLC`: the Erlang 'erlc' command to use, `erlc` by default

 * `TMPDIR`: temporary directory for database directories, logs, etc

 * `VERSION`, `RABBIT_VSN`: the RabbitMQ version number, `0.0.0` by default


## Packaging

### Consider Using a Snapshot

Before building a distribution from source, consider using [a snapshot build](https://www.rabbitmq.com/snapshots.html)
instead. For contributions that were merged into one of the maintained release
branches, there should typically be no reason to build from source as snapshot
releases will be published in the next 15 minutes to several hours (depending on
the change and how busy the pipeline is).

### Producing a Distribution from Source

The distro-specific packaging targets are now integrated into the 
top-level build system. You should need to do no more than:

``` shell
make VERSION=3.8.10.snapshot.1 RABBIT_VSN=3.8.10.snapshot.1 UNOFFICIAL_RELEASE=1 dist
```

to build debs and rpms, along with the source and binary tarballs. If
you just want to build one package, you can use the targets
debian_packages, rpm_packages or java_packages in the top-level
Makefile.

You need to have cdbs installed to build the Debian packages, and rpm 
for the Fedora packages.

The variable `UNOFFICIAL_RELEASE` is used to determine whether packages 
should be signed: if the variable is set then they will not be 
signed, otherwise they will be. The signing key ID is `056E8E56`.

`UNOFFICIAL_RELEASE` is also used by the Debian target to determine 
changelog behaviour. If it is not set, then debian/changelog must 
contain an entry for the version string in `<Version>`. If it is set, 
it creates a fake changelog entry.
