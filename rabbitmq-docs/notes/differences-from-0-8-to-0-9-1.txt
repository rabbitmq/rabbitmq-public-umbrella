Semantically, there are a few differences between 0-8 and 0-9-1;
here's a summary:

 - The advertised version number is major=0,minor=9,revision=1 rather
   than major=8,minor=0.

 - Frame types 4-7 (OOB and trace frames) have been removed, as they
   were not well specified in AMQP 0-8.

 - Status code changes:
	- Removed:
		NOT_DELIVERED		310
	- Added:
		NO_ROUTE		312 (missing from spec???)
		NO_CONSUMERS		313
		PRECONDITION_FAILED	406
		UNEXPECTED_FRAME	505

 - Access tickets have been removed. This involves the removal of the
   Access.Request method, and the deprecation of each and every ticket
   field in methods that used to require a ticket.

 - The restrictions on virtual-host names have been removed.

 - The notions of "known hosts" and of connection redirection have
   been removed.

 - The (AMQP-specific) "PLAIN" security mechanism is no longer
   mentioned.

 - The meaning of "channel-max" has been clarified: for example, if
   channel-max is set to 2, then it is illegal to use channels
   numbered 3 or higher for frames carried by the connection.

 - The meaning of "frame-max" has been clarified: the maximum frame
   size is to be interpreted as including the counts for the frame
   header and end-byte.

 - A new rule (named "upper-limit") regarding channel-max has been
   added: if the client asks for channel-max higher than that offered
   by the server, the connection MUST be closed without attempting a
   negotiated close.

 - A similar rule (also named "upper-limit") applies to frame-max: if
   the client asks for frame-max higher than that offered by the
   server, the connection MUST be closed without attempting a
   negotiated close.

 - The extensibility of the exchange-type mechanism is now explicitly
   documented.

 - The rules for equivalence of exchange instances in Exchange.Declare
   have been more clearly specified, including a specification of how
   the "arguments" tables are to be compared.

 - Auto-deletion of exchanges is no longer supported.

 - The AMQP 0-8 notion of "content classes" has been removed.

 - The rules for equivalence of queues in Queue.Declare have been more
   clearly specified.

 - The rules regarding declaration of "exclusive" queues have been
   more tightly specified.

 - A single Basic.Publish is now defined to never result in multiple
   copies of a message on any particular queue, even in the presence
   of multiple independent bindings to the same queue that match the
   published message.

 - Durable queues may now bind to transient exchanges. Bindings
   between a durable queue and an exchange are as durable as the bound
   exchange is.

 - If two or more different bindings to a single queue apply to a
   given publication, only one copy of the published message is placed
   on the queue. This was intended, but not specified, in 0-8.

 - The error code for use of an empty queue name in Queue.Bind (and
   other methods that use the most-recently-declared-queue mechanism)
   has been changed.

 - The empty string may now be specified in Queue.Bind's "exchange"
   field; it signifies the default exchange (!).

 - Basic.Recover has changed: the old behaviour is available via a
   (deprecated) method Basic.RecoverAsync, which has method ID 100
   (which in 0-8 was the ID for Basic.Recover). In 0-9-1,
   Basic.Recover has ID 110, and now has a required response,
   Basic.RecoverOk (ID 111). Also, both Basic.Recover and
   Basic.RecoverAsync are permitted on (Tx-)transacted channels in
   0-9-1, which was forbidden in 0-8.

 - Basic.Ack is now required to signal a channel error immediately
   upon detecting an invalid deliveryTag, even if the channel is
   (Tx-)transacted. Also, it is now explicitly forbidden to
   acknowledge a particular deliveryTag more than once.

 - Consumer tags (in Basic.Consume etc) are defined as local to a
   channel now, not local to a connection.

 - Message priorities have been clarified: priority 9 is the highest
   priority level (meaning that messages with priority 9 will be
   delivered ahead of any lower-priority messages), and priority 0 is
   the lowest priority level.

 - If a Channel.Close is received while a peer is waiting for a
   Channel.CloseOk, a Channel.CloseOk must be sent in response as
   usual. Previously, in 0-8, such a Channel.Close was required to be
   ignored.

 - If a Connection.Close is received while a peer is waiting for a
   Connection.CloseOk, a Connection.CloseOk must be sent in response
   as usual. Previously, in 0-8, such a Connection.Close was required
   to be ignored.

 - Channel.Flow is specified to not apply to content carried by
   Basic.GetOk methods.

 - Exchange.Declare's Durable field is no longer ignored in cases when
   the named exchange already exists at the time of the declaration.

 - The server now MUST NOT delete an exchange that has bindings on it
   if the IfUnused field is true during an Exchange.Delete.

 - The XML requires an "amq.headers" exchange if the "headers"
   exchange type is implemented; the PDF requires an "amq.match"
   exchange if the "headers" exchange type is implemented. This is an
   error and will be resolved in a future release of the 0-9 series of
   specifications; the intention is for "amq.headers" to be
   required. "amq.match" is a legacy name and is now deprecated.

 - It is now explicitly specified that Queue.Delete on an AutoDelete
   queue is permitted and meaningful.

 - The rules on exclusive queues have changed: exclusivity now applies
   not just to consuming from the queue, but also to
   Basic.Get. Furthermore, passive declarations of an exclusively-held
   queue on other connections are now disallowed.

 - Generally, passive declarations are now specified to ignore most of
   the parameters given to the declaration other than the name of the
   declared entity. This was not specified in 0-8.

 - The server now MUST NOT delete a queue that has messages in it if
   the IfEmpty field is true during a Queue.Delete.

 - When Queue.Purge is called, sent-but-unacknowledged messages are no
   longer purged, even if the channel they were sent down is not
   (Tx-)transacted.

 - Class Tx has new language around atomicity and
   multiple-queue-transactions.

 - The effects of the "immediate" and "mandatory" flags on
   Basic.Publish are explicitly declared to be undefined when used
   within a Tx transaction in 0-9-1.

 - Tx.Rollback has been clarified: unacked messages will NOT be
   redelivered in 0-9-1 upon rollback.

 - The "no-local" field is specified to prohibit delivery to the
   connection that published a message in 0-9-1. In 0-8, it was not
   specified whether the scope of prohibition was the channel or the
   connection.

 - It is made clear in section 1.4.1 of the main spec that strings are
   case-sensitive.

 - References to "chained bindings", nested message contents
   ("structured contents"), message selectors, weight, out-of-band
   frames etc have been removed.

 - There is new specification around errors detected during connection
   establishment (see the end of sections 2.2.4).

 - Section 2.2.9 reiterates the lack of requeuing and redelivering on
   Tx.Rollback.

 - Section 2.3.7 explains the changes made to the connection and
   channel close protocols.

 - The "Headers" exchange type is now defined (section 3.1.3.4).

 - The use of UNEXPECTED_FRAME (code 505) is documented in section
   4.2.6.

 - The content body size field has been clarified to mean the sum of
   the body sizes of the following content body frames.

 - Heartbeating has been specified (section 4.2.7).

 - Sections 4.4 (Visibility Guarantee), 4.5 (Channel Closure), 4.6
   (Content Synchronisation) and 4.7 (Content Ordering Guarantees) are
   new, interesting, and important.

 - Some methods have been removed:

   Connection.Redirect
   Channel.Alert

 - Some methods have been renumbered:

                        AMQP 0-8        AMQP 0-9-1
   Connection.Close     60              50
   Connection.CloseOk   61              51
   Basic.Recover	(see explanation above)

 - Some methods have been added:

   Queue.Unbind, methodId 50
   Queue.UnbindOk, methodId 51

 - Some methods have new or changed arguments:

   (many methods)	short		Ticket			deprecated
   Connection.Open	shortstr	Capabilities		deprecated
   Connection.Open	bit		Insist			deprecated
   Connection.OpenOk	shortstr	KnownHosts		deprecated
   Channel.Open		shortstr	OutOfBand		deprecated
   Channel.OpenOk	longstr					added, then deprecated
   Exchange.Declare	bit		AutoDelete		deprecated
   Exchange.Declare	bit		Internal		deprecated
   Basic.GetEmpty	shortstr	ClusterId		deprecated
   Basic.Consume	table		Filter			added
   File.Consume		table		Filter			added
   Stream.Consume	table		Filter			added

 - Some classes have been removed:

   Access
   Dtx
   File
   Stream
   Test
   Tunnel

 - The Basic class's content properties have been changed:

   AppId		shortstr	deprecated

Framing and connection establishment (modulo the removed frame-types
and the spec version number advertisement, respectively) are
identical.
